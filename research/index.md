This section highlights some of my research experiences. At UNC Chapel Hill, I continuously worked towards a Carolina Research Scholar Designation. This includes my time with Dr. Martin Styner at his Neuro Image Research and Analysis Laboratory (NIRAL) from 2020-2021, my 2021 summer with UNC's Office for Undergraduate Research as a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF)recipient, and an external internship with Dr. John House and Dr. Alison Motsinger-Reif at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences from 2021-2022.
