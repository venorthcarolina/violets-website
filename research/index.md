# {% include icon.html icon="fa fa-file" %}Research Highlights & Projects

This section highlights some of my research experiences, mainly from before my time at the IAA. At UNC Chapel Hill, I continuously worked towards a Carolina Research Scholar Designation. Carolina Research Scholars are recognized for their contributions to UNC’s intellectual and cultural climate with a “Carolina Research Scholar” designation on their transcript. This includes my time with Dr. Martin Styner at his Neuro Image Research and Analysis Laboratory (NIRAL) from 2020-2021, my 2021 summer with UNC's Office for Undergraduate Research as a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) recipient, and an external internship with Dr. John House and Dr. Alison Motsinger-Reif at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) from 2021-2022. 

I also enjoy exploring topics outside the classroom and working on side projects. My projects can be found below, in addition to my research.
