Today, I finally started my new role at the Durham VA Medical Center. I have been looking forward to starting for so long! In my last blog post, I highlighted what the onboarding process was like; however, I left out most of the goal setting and career brainstorming I did over the last five months. I often find myself motivated by setting actionable goals by specific deadlines. It helps me brainstorm what I value and how I can achieve that end result in a sustainable, path-of-least-resistance way. 

I've set the following three goals for the next few months at the VA, and went into my first day of work with these in mind:
1. Show up authentically to work. Make an effort to join conversations and provide input without being intimidated.
2. Maintain work life balance. Be intentional in sustaining relationships (friends, family, etc.) without overextending.
3. Become technically proficient and obtaining transferrable skills while at the VA. I want to feel like I don’t have to look things up a ton or struggle in coding.

My mind full of goals, fears of traffic, and schedule jam packed, I showed up to work at 8 a.m. anxious but ready to start. Being myself, I purposely left some time to figure out the parking situation; I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to park in the parking deck as there are several gates blocking off entrances. Parking is everyone's first day nightmare, but especially mine as I hate diving! Thankfully, all the gates were open and I was able to snag a spot- as one of the first people at the office. I followed the trickle of people from the parking deck to the building, and quickly caught on that I walked into the basement. My manager, Sandra, and I had agreed on meeting on the concourse at 8 am sharp, so I rushed up the stairs in an effort to meet her. I stomped up to the ground floor stairwell to no avail. I couldn't figure out how to get out! I also almost ran smack into two ladders sitting by the door. In a small panic, I heard a door behind me open. Taking a deep breath, I rushed over to the person emerging and blurted out, "Do you know how to get out?". And alas, to my disbelief, I found Sandra.

My manager Sandra, my assigned onboarding buddy Livia, and I kicked off the morning by taking the elevator up to the sixth floor to the HR office. I found myself settling into the HR desk quickly while on the phone with a specialist, who was to help me obtain my temporary password to my login credentials. I hadn't gotten a chance to grab my PIV card yet and could not log in to any of the things I needed to access on my computer! This call took longer than expected since the first phone call dropped. My morning was indeed off to a start.

However, things quickly took a turn for the better. After calling back (and going through the entire questionnaire again), I successfully received my temporary password. I also took some time to look over my HR welcome packet before my 6 hour onboarding call began. However, as 9:15 rolled around and I logged onto the WebEx, I realized that I had the time wrong. My new employee orientation was scheduled for 9:15 Central Time not Eastern Time!

I was able to get a tour around our office located in the Mutual Life Towers of downtown Durham. I kicked off the morning with grabbing coffee with Livia at Press Coffee & Crepes, just a 10-minute walk away from the office. I enjoyed my morning dose of caffeine in the form of a cappuccino and found Livia easy to converse with and get to know. The support I found from getting an assigned buddy was immense, because I knew that as I had questions arise, I could go ask Livia quickly. Livia also had her door access, so I could bug her when I needed to get in and out of the office suite.

After feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle New Employee Orientation (NEO), I headed back for my 4-hour call. I’ll spare you all the details, but the rest of the NEO time block from 10:30 to 2:30 included PowerPoint informational sessions, a very comprehensive benefits overview, getting sworn into office, and running paperwork to our HR representative, Nancy. I also got my seasonal flu shot during my 30-minute lunch break, saving me from filing extra VA paperwork.
