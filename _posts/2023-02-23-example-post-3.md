At the Institute, we all get assigned to practicum sponsors and teams of five for our yearlong project. Even though it was over 10 months ago, I still distinctly remember the nervous pit in my stomach when it was "reveal" day. With a class of 95 students and a split between Blue and Orange cohorts, I knew that I could end up with any four other classmates on my team. I also had no idea which corporate sponsor I'd be assigned to.

When reveal day came around, and I tenderly opened the Google Sheets document revealing both sponsors and teammates simultaneously, I heaved out a sigh of relief. I got assigned to Andrew Burnette as team lead, who I knew to be level-headed, responsible, and kind. He and I were both in Blue cohort over the summer, and I had spoken to him a few times. I was unfamiliar with the other three names on the document- all three had been in Orange cohort over the summer and I had never spoken to them before. However, by graduation in May, our practicum team would be known as THE team; we all communicated well, produced incredible deliverables, and enjoyed each others' company.

Tae Lee, my fellow Asian teammate, ended up being a close confidant throughout the job placement process. He and I did many mock interviews and prep together, and I always felt comfortable to talk with Tae whether it was about Asian cuisine, planning my solo trip to Korea, or asking about the D.C. food scene. Can you tell that I'm a foodie?

Blake Holmes, the class clown and lighthearted jokester, also became a great friend and helpful classmate. Since Blake and I often sat together in the front row, we often exchanged quips about our assignments. Never have I had a conversation with Blake and not felt immediately less stressed afterwards. Blake often helped lighten the mood of our team meetings with his seamless jokes.

I would say that my relationship with Salem Wear, the Alabama native and the only other girl on the team, had the most development. Initially, I expected us to automatically click and become close friends, especially since we were on the same homework team for the first fall module of the program. However, I experienced something like gradual friendship. As we continued through the fall semester and to the spring, I saw Salem to be responsible, kind, and conversational. One of her strengths throughout the job placement process was being able to empathize and remain positive. I also had the chance to partner with Salem on a practicum deliverable that focused on clustering. Through our working relationship, we became good friends and bonded over running.
