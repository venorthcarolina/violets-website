At the Institute, we all get assigned to practicum sponsors and teams of five for our yearlong project. Even though it was over 10 months ago, I still distinctly remember the nervous pit in my stomach when it was "reveal" day. With a class of 95 students and a split between Blue and Orange cohorts, I knew that I could end up with any four other classmates on my team. I also had no idea which government or corporate sponsor I'd be assigned to.

When reveal day came around, and as I tenderly opened the Google Sheets document revealing both sponsors and teammates simultaneously, I heaved out a sigh of relief. I got assigned to Andrew Burnette as team lead, who I knew to be level-headed, responsible, and kind. He and I were both in Blue cohort over the summer, and I had spoken to him a few times. I was unfamiliar with the other three names on the document- all three had been in Orange cohort over the summer and I had never spoken to them before. However, by graduation in May, our practicum team would be known as THE team; we all communicated well, produced incredible deliverables, and enjoyed each others' company.

Tae Lee, my fellow Asian teammate, ended up being a close confidant throughout the job placement process. He and I did many mock interviews and prep together, and I always felt comfortable to talk with Tae whether it was about Asian cuisine, planning my solo trip to Korea, or asking about the D.C. food scene. Can you tell that I'm a foodie?

Blake Holmes, the class clown and lighthearted jokester, also became a great friend and helpful classmate. Since Blake and I often sat together in the front row, we often exchanged quips about our assignments. Never have I had a conversation with Blake and not felt immediately less stressed afterwards. Blake often helped lighten the mood of our team meetings with his seamless jokes.

I would say that my relationship with Salem Wear, the Alabama native and the only other girl on the team, had the most development. Initially, I expected us to automatically click and become close friends, especially since we were on the same homework team for the first fall module of the program. However, I experienced something like gradual friendship. As we continued through the fall semester and to the spring, I saw Salem to be responsible, kind, and conversational. One of her strengths throughout the job placement process was being able to empathize and remain positive. I also had the chance to partner with Salem on a practicum deliverable that focused on clustering. Through our working relationship, we became good friends and bonded over running.

Like all teams composed of diverse individuals, my team did have disagreements; however, one of our biggest strengths was communication. For example, if I had an idea that others disagreed about, I found that my teammates were willing to hear me through on my idea, make pro/con lists with me, and come to a team consensus on how to proceed. For example, I wanted our team to move over to Git for code changes and keeping consistency. I brought a PowerPoint deck to one of our meetings and suggested that we implement the strategy. Despite the difficulties in implementing the software on our remote servers, my team followed my PowerPoint instructions in getting Git set up. Once we completed the set up, various teammates voiced their concerns in a way that was both respectful but to the point. I appreciated the communication and willingness to give my idea a shot!

Reflecting on my time at the Institute, I feel that most of my challenges stemmed from the practicum project. Our team of five faced numerous obstacles and challenges in providing finalized deliverables to our sponsor. Despite this, I am incredibly grateful for my team's support and flexibility. I hope to stay in touch!
