<p>At the Institute, we all get assigned to practicum sponsors and teams of five for our yearlong project. Even though it was over 10 months ago, I still distinctly remember the nervous pit in my stomach when it was “reveal” day. With a class of 95 students and a split between Blue and Orange cohorts, I knew that I could end up with any four other classmates on my team. I also had no idea which corporate sponsor I’d be assigned to.</p>

<p>When reveal day came around, and I tenderly opened the Google Sheets document revealing both sponsors and teammates simultaneously, I heaved out a sigh of relief. I got assigned to Andrew Burnette as team lead, who I knew to be level-headed, responsible, and kind. He and I were both in Blue cohort over the summer, and I had spoken to him a few times. I was unfamiliar with the other three names on the document- all three had been in Orange cohort over the summer and I had never spoken to them before. However, by graduation in May, our practicum team would be known as THE team; we all communicated well, produced incredible deliverables, and enjoyed each others’ company.</p>

<p>Tae Lee, my fellow Asian teammate, ended up being a close confidant throughout the job placement process. He and I did many mock interviews and prep together, and I always felt comfortable to talk with Tae whether it was about Asian cuisine, planning my solo trip to Korea, or asking about the D.C. food scene. Can you tell that I’m a foodie?</p>

<p>Blake Holmes, the class clown and lighthearted jokester, also became a great friend and helpful classmate. Since Blake and I often sat together in the front row, we often exchanged quips about our assignments. Never have I had a conversation with Blake and not felt immediately less stressed afterwards. Blake often helped lighten the mood of our team meetings with his seamless jokes.</p>

<p>I would say that my relationship with Salem Wear, the Alabama native and the only other girl on the team, had the most development. Initially, I expected us to automatically click and become close friends, especially since we were on the same homework team for the first fall module of the program. However, I experienced something like gradual friendship. As we continued through the fall semester and to the spring, I saw Salem to be responsible, kind, and conversational. One of her strengths throughout the job placement process was being able to empathize and remain positive. I also had the chance to partner with Salem on a practicum deliverable that focused on clustering. Through our working relationship, we became good friends and bonded over running.</p>

<p>Like all teams composed of diverse individuals, my team did have disagreements; however, one of our biggest strengths was communication. For example, if I had an idea that others disagreed about, I found that my teammates were willing to hear me through on my idea, make pro/con lists with me, and come to a team consensus on how to proceed. For example, I wanted our team to move over to Git for code changes and keeping consistency. I brought a PowerPoint deck to one of our meetings and suggested that we implement the strategy. Despite the difficulties in implementing the software on our remote servers, my team followed my PowerPoint instructions in getting Git set up. Once we completed the set up, various teammates voiced their concerns in a way that was both respectful but to the point. I appreciated the communication and willingness to give my idea a shot!</p>]]></content><author><name>Violet Evans</name></author><category term="teamwork," /><category term="ncsu," /><category term="practicum" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the Institute, we all get assigned to practicum sponsors and teams of five for our yearlong project.

<p>Reflection On Internship Experiences</p>

<p>Looking back at my three and a half years at UNC Chapel Hill, one of my proudest moments was when I received my dream summer internship at CVS Health. My main goal in professional extracurricular experiences was to gain real-world experience and get quality feedback on my work.</p>

<p>I saw CVS Health as an opportunity to get hands-on experience on projects under direct supervision while working on a team to achieve larger corporate goals. The internship provided me with just those dreams – I worked on a health equity roadmap intervention for dialysis patients in Austin, Texas, collaborated with communication team members to update the internal Sharepoint site, and even shadowed a master’s data science student working on a similar project about social determinants of health. 
The jobs right out of undergrad fit for my skill set seemed to be focused on statistical programming rather than having a larger variety of tasks and independence in projects, while graduate school would provide education on a specialist topic and help me gain in-depth knowledge. I found a year-long remote research position at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and decided that this experience would cement my decision for the future – if I enjoyed research, I’d pursue a PhD; otherwise, I decided I would do a master’s.</p>

<p>My summer, fall, and spring at NIEHS was a huge learning curve, but it provided time where I could experiment in R Studio, better understand bioinformatics, and explore a federal research environment. My program guided eleven undergraduates in professional workshops and through poster presentations to a broader NIEHS audience. I found value in the networking opportunities and the collaborative teamwork elements of the program. I also realized I enjoyed the coding and problem-solving more than the aspects of genomic data and methodology.</p>

<p>Reflection On Graduate School</p>

<p>I recognized the necessity of obtaining a master’s degree, yet the recurring question that plagued me was, “Which specific field should I pursue?” Some criteria that cycled through my mind included being relatively affordable, with a strong preference for in-state in North Carolina, having less than a two-year commitment, and providing a strong record for employment following graduation. I debated between a degree in public health, business, or statistics; specifically, UNC has a great two-year biostatistics master of science, and Boston University has a one-year applied biostatistics program with good ties to the life sciences.</p>

<p>Reflection On the Institute</p>

<p>The gradual realization of why I needed graduate school began to outweigh all of my criteria for staying in the public health realm of my undergraduate major, and I began to learn about the Institute for Advanced Analytics and NCSU. The 10-month program fulfilled all of my criteria for graduate school, and an added benefit was the close proximity to my family. I began leaning towards the idea of a non-public health data science program and committed to my decision. Since I’ve been in the program, I haven’t looked back, not even once. The “why data analytics?” question quickly became answered as coursework in foundational statistics, Python and R programming, and summer practicum ramped up. I found myself immersed in how to communicate data science to a non-technical audience and set personal goals for applying data analytics. The application aspect of the program has been crucial to my development as a data scientist.</p>

<p>In the last three months, I’ve already assembled a complete pie of knowledge and skills. Each slice on my plate represents a different aspect of our cohort’s learning journey, including statistics, programming, ethical considerations for data professionals, cross-cultural communication, computer security, networking in a professional context, and the art of setting tangible goals. We continue to fill our plates, one day at a time.</p>]]></content><author><name>Violet Evans</name></author><category term="graduate school" /><category term="NCSU" /><category term="Institute for Advanced Analytics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my first week in the program, the question I received the most was: “What made you want to come to the Institute?” Although my answer is complex, most often, I would respond that I studied biostatistics at UNC for my undergraduate studies – as if this was an explanation for pursuing graduate school.
