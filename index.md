Hi everyone! My name is Violet, and I am a recent graduate of the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University (NCSU), where I earned my M.S. in Analytics. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Institute, taking courses in statistics, logistic regression, and time series. I also served as Scrum Master for my yearlong practicum with Antares Tech. In this role, I worked on a team of five to help manage the product backlog and set up biweekly sprints following Agile Methodology. Our student team successfully delivered three main deliverables to support customer retention strategies. 

My undergraduate degrees are in Biostatistics (B.S.P.H.) and Asian Studies- Chinese (B.A.) from UNC Chapel Hill. Passionate about quantitative aspects and interested in global perspectives, I chose to pursue a public health degree with a quantitative focus, aspiring to make a real-world impact on populations. I also minored in Mathematics and served as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for my favorite course, differential equations. 

In my free time, you might find me running, exploring new cities, or trying out local restaurants with friends. As a Raleigh native, I am still currently located in North Carolina.
