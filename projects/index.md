# {% include icon.html icon="fa fa-heart" %} Resume & Past Experiences

As a recent M.S. in Analytics graduate from the Institute for Advanced Analytics at NCSU, I am eager to apply my statistics and data science skills to organizations that leverage big data to tackle pressing challenges. I also have an undergraduate background in biostatistics, health equity, and research from UNC Chapel Hill. Please see below for additional information about my past experiences.
