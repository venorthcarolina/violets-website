# {% include icon.html icon="fa fa-heart" %} Resume and Experiences

As a recent graduate of the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University (NCSU) with an M.S. in Analytics, I am enthusiastic about applying my statistics and data science knowledge to explore organizations that leverage big data to tackle pressing challenges. I also have undergraduate experience in biostatistics, health equity, and research from UNC Chapel Hill.
