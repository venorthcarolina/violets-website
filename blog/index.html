<p>Hi everyone, and welcome to my personal blog. I have been passionate about blogging since I was 9, when I created my own Weebly domain for my cat club. I’ve come a long way since then, but my passion for writing still remains. Below I show some of my past blog posts, with topics ranging from my journey to graduate school to my experience taking a gap year in Nanjing, China. I hope to keep up with my blog as I continue to transition into my next phase of life.</p>

      <p data-search="I will admit  it s been a while since I have updated my blog  However  it s for good reason  I moved to Durham  began a part time babysitting job  and also have been undergoing paperwork process for the Veterans Affairs  VA  Medical Center  Since my full time role will be based in Durham and full in office for the first 90 days  I decided early on that it was important for me to move to Durham  I am not a fan of driving  and in an ideal world  would like less than a 15 minute commute to work  I reached out to my former classmate at UNC a few months ago about living together  While she and I both studied biostatistics at UNC  I chose a more applied path at NCSU while she chose a more rigorous  math heavy path at Duke  She s currently a second year master s candidate at Duke s M S  in Biostatistics program  The timing was impeccable for a one year lease in Durham Our move went fairly smoothly  and I will spare you all of the details  However  I wanted to highlight the convenience of being able to get to most of my day to day places with ease  In our new apartment  I am able to get to Harris Teeter  Food Lion  the gas station  Five Below  and the auto shop within 3 minutes of driving  I am also a 8 minute drive from downtown Durham and hence my office in the N C  Mutual Life building  Although I will likely not renew my lease in the apartment buildings I live in  I am really enjoying being close to all the places I need to be  I also enjoy being close to the families I babysit for I wanted to use the rest of this blog as space to highlight the trials and tribulations I have been through for the VA Medical Center  Since receiving a verbal offer in May this year  I have had to jump through many hoops to complete paperwork  Although the team I am joining is a group local to Durham  I had to undergo the processing on a federal level  This meant after receiving my verbal offer  I had to wait for HR to reach out to me  My assigned HR specialist was  missing  for over two months during the summer  and paperwork did not start moving along until August  I received my intiial job offer paperwork in August  with multiple clearances to pass after signing The first task to complete was my forms and other tasks  This included my I 9  as well as other general onboarding paperwork in the USA Staffing onboarding account  Luckily  I was able to breeze through this stack of items fairly quickly in just a few hours The second task was to complete my background investigation and fingerprints through an electronic questionnaire  e QIP   Since I have worked for the federal government before  I was actually auto cleared through the e QIP  saving me from multiple hours of paperwork  I am extremely thankful  For the fingerprints  someone from the PIV card office contacted me about scheduling federal fingerprints and creating a badge appointment  Once I was contacted  I was able to get into the office within a week or so  I really appreciated the location of my apartment since I could walk to the Veterans Affairs Medical Center and did not have to worry about parking  The fingerprinting  badging  and other forms only took about 30 minutes The last task I completed was working with Employee Occupation Health  EOH   The local EOH contacted me to obtain a copy of my immunization record and draw blood  I was surprised that they did not need to take my vitals or do a physical health examination  The immunization records cleared immediately  however  drawing blood took some time  I had over seven vials of blood taken  This was to test for each of my immunizations  including MMR   hepatitis  and COVID 19 Now that my initial job offer paperwork is completed and all my clearances are checked off  I am waiting on my final job offer  FJO   Supposedly  my start date is either October 3rd or Octobe 17th  due to government pay period  I have not yet received my FJO  but have reached out to both my manager and the assigned HR Specialist in the meantime  It turns out that they are  missing   so my next action item will be to track down the FJO individual  with hopes of starting on the previous date  Stay tuned to hear about my start date and next adventures ">
        I will admit, it’s been a while since I have updated my blog. However, it’s for good reason- I moved to Durham, began a part-time babysitting job, and also have been undergoing paperwork process for the Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. Since my full time role will be based in Durham and full in office for the first 90 days, I decided early on that it was important for me to move to Durham. I am not a fan of driving, and in an ideal world, would like less than a 15 minute commute to work. I reached out to my former classmate at UNC a few months ago about living together. While she and I both studied biostatistics at UNC, I chose a more applied path at NCSU while she chose a more rigorous, math-heavy path at Duke. She’s currently a second-year master’s candidate at Duke’s M.S. in Biostatistics program. The timing was impeccable for a one year lease in Durham.

At the Institute, we all get assigned to practicum sponsors and teams of five for our yearlong project. Even though it was over 10 months ago, I still distinctly remember the nervous pit in my stomach when it was “reveal” day. With a class of 95 students and a split between Blue and Orange cohorts, I knew that I could end up with any four other classmates on my team. I also had no idea which government or corporate sponsor I’d be assigned to.

      <p data-search="During my first week in the program  the question I received the most was   What made you want to come to the Institute   Although my answer is complex  most often  I would respond that I studied biostatistics at UNC for my undergraduate studies   as if this was an explanation for pursuing graduate school  In this post  I reflect on my monumental experiences in undergrad by exploring my gradual realization of why I needed a master s degree and discussing why I chose data analytics Reflection On Internship ExperiencesLooking back at my three and a half years at UNC Chapel Hill  one of my proudest moments was when I received my dream summer internship at CVS Health  My main goal in professional extracurricular experiences was to gain real world experience and get quality feedback on my work I saw CVS Health as an opportunity to get hands on experience on projects under direct supervision while working on a team to achieve larger corporate goals  The internship provided me with just those dreams   I worked on a health equity roadmap intervention for dialysis patients in Austin  Texas  collaborated with communication team members to update the internal Sharepoint site  and even shadowed a master s data science student working on a similar project about social determinants of health  The jobs right out of undergrad fit for my skill set seemed to be focused on statistical programming rather than having a larger variety of tasks and independence in projects  while graduate school would provide education on a specialist topic and help me gain in depth knowledge  I found a year long remote research position at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  NIEHS  and decided that this experience would cement my decision for the future   if I enjoyed research  I d pursue a PhD  otherwise  I decided I would do a master s My summer  fall  and spring at NIEHS was a huge learning curve  but it provided time where I could experiment in R Studio  better understand bioinformatics  and explore a federal research environment  My program guided eleven undergraduates in professional workshops and through poster presentations to a broader NIEHS audience  I found value in the networking opportunities and the collaborative teamwork elements of the program  I also realized I enjoyed the coding and problem solving more than the aspects of genomic data and methodology Reflection On Graduate SchoolI recognized the necessity of obtaining a master s degree  yet the recurring question that plagued me was   Which specific field should I pursue   Some criteria that cycled through my mind included being relatively affordable  with a strong preference for in state in North Carolina  having less than a two year commitment  and providing a strong record for employment following graduation  I debated between a degree in public health  business  or statistics  specifically  UNC has a great two year biostatistics master of science  and Boston University has a one year applied biostatistics program with good ties to the life sciences Reflection On the InstituteThe gradual realization of why I needed graduate school began to outweigh all of my criteria for staying in the public health realm of my undergraduate major  and I began to learn about the Institute for Advanced Analytics and NCSU  The 10 month program fulfilled all of my criteria for graduate school  and an added benefit was the close proximity to my family  I began leaning towards the idea of a non public health data science program and committed to my decision  Since I ve been in the program  I haven t looked back  not even once  The  why data analytics   question quickly became answered as coursework in foundational statistics  Python and R programming  and summer practicum ramped up  I found myself immersed in how to communicate data science to a non technical audience and set personal goals for applying data analytics  The application aspect of the program has been crucial to my development as a data scientist In the last three months  I ve already assembled a complete pie of knowledge and skills  Each slice on my plate represents a different aspect of our cohort s learning journey  including statistics  programming  ethical considerations for data professionals  cross cultural communication  computer security  networking in a professional context  and the art of setting tangible goals  We continue to fill our plates  one day at a time ">
        During my first week in the program, the question I received the most was: “What made you want to come to the Institute?” Although my answer is complex, most often, I would respond that I studied biostatistics at UNC for my undergraduate studies – as if this was an explanation for pursuing graduate school. In this post, I reflect on my monumental experiences in undergrad by exploring my gradual realization of why I needed a master’s degree and discussing why I chose data analytics.

      <p data-search="A Conclusion   One Year Later As I kept a journal the whole time I was abroad  and re read it all to figure out how to voice these blogs  I really want to share a meaningful entry  This was from 7 6  the night before I left Nanjing  The week before I wrote this  I had been running biking metro taking around saying goodbyes  visiting tourist sites and celebrating my friendships with all the people that were also headed home  Ok now that it s feeling like goodbye time  I just wanted to write this goodbye  Liike we moved all the furniture  it s the first night I haven t been busy   amp  I m just sitting here thinking about this semester  It hasn t actually hit me I m leaving  I m saying goodbye to all that has happened here  all that s changed me and all the relationships formed  Because last week felt like I was a happy robot  a person on a mission and a bubble of non reality  But now it feels different  like tomorrow I finish packing up my adventure of a year  wrapping up my feelings  putting a bow on my head like a pacakge   amp  traveling home  It s like all my dreams are coming true  so it s nostalgic but ITS FINALLY HAPPENING I have so many mixed feelings now that the day is actually here  I don t know  I just feel like second semester went by so fast  I m not sure where the time went  but it s just been so good  I am going to look at old pics now to take a trip down memory lane  As I m continuing my night in my bed reading my Mao book  I am also thinking about how much culture I ve learned  I think studying abroad  amp  explaining to other people why you think the way you think  why you do things the way you do also makes you grow  Just like saying  oh  in America  we do this  Or  oh  in this holiday  we do this  Like I literally explained to JiSoo that it was 4th of July a few days ago  and people wear swimsuits  grill out and put off fireworks  I don t know  I also realize how much more chill am  Like I can just go with the flow and understand that other people also have plans  I ve changed so much  I am so proud  lt 3  Something about my last weeks in China were so special  Perhaps it s because I didn t know how things would pan out  that I d be meeting up with people on the fly  Or perhaps because I didn t know time could even possibly feel so absolutely dragged out  It was as if every day was another closer to home  but also one less day with my friends  It was a strange time I think the most meaningful part of the end of my time in China was saying the goodbyes  Coming back to the US  I feel that my friends here just don t share that same bond with me  The people in China were different  because they also experienced many struggles  Whether it was difficulties with the food  balancing schedules  or being in the same boat of homesickness  the people I met abroad were unique because of the obstacles we overcame together  These relationships made saying goodbye even better  and our last days together were even more valued  The best part of all the endings was that I had my friend Iana through every single goodbye meal with other people  up until the day I left  She was the one that said farewell to me  sending me off into the taxi towards the airport  and that meant a lot to me When I left  I was sad that all the relationships I made were put on pause  and that we had to part our ways  But I m so glad I have made some forever friends  I know that if I ever backpack through Europe after college like I always talk about or if these friends come to the US  we will be able to reconnect  even without constant contact throughout the years  I shared a special bond with a lot of people  through hardships  laughter  and adventures  So this last post is dedicated to them  to the people that shaped my year abroad  that made learning Chinese more fun  and to the forever memories  ingrained into our hearts During the last few weeks  someone told me to end my blog with a picture of myself from the end of the year  So here I am  Trying to stay present  Open minded  Forever growing ">

      <p data-search=" I feel like the past month has just been planning for the end  yet  it s all the start for a new beginning    a quote by me from my journal By the beginning of June  I was ready to go home  I could count the weeks left on one hand  literally had every last weekend planned out  and knew how my final exams at the end of the month were going to pan out  Despite these hard facts and feelings that I had come so far  I didn t actually know how my end time in China was going to turn out Turns out  June was one of the weirdest months of all  Living abroad  I fell into a pattern  Patterns of sleep  eating  studying  and going to class  But this last period of time felt like a deviation from those patterns  It was like the final home stretch  except 5 weeks long  36 days on a countdown timer  and already full of lots of things planned out I had previously planned that I wanted to keep traveling on the weekends  and as mentioned before  I had a trip to see my friend from the US in Hangzhou scheduled  However  I had no idea that I was going to end up in the suburbs of Shanghai  visiting my former Chinese tutor on a whim  It was an absolutely wonderful visit  and it was so nice to feel like I was relaxing with a family  My tutor lives in a typical Chinese apartment  with three bedrooms  two bathrooms  and within walking distance to a supermarket  I loved staying with her  where I got to stay in my own room  play with her five year old daughter  and get insight on how she her husband and father all work together as a family  The Chinese family feels very close knit and well organized  and it was really a relief to have a pause from the campus lifestyle Upon return from Shanghai  I hit the home stretch of classes  The last two weeks felt so stretched out  but thank goodness I had a visit to Hangzhou planned among those weeks  Because it was Dragon Boat Festival  we had an extra day off from class  So again I hopped on a bullet train  slept the whole trip  I never have not slept on a train   and got off so excited to see my old friend  My friend  Holly  has been my friend since our freshman year of high school  we are really good friends and have been able to witness each other s growth throughout high school  During my time in China  though  I hadn t kept in touch with her  I think that was why she was able to see how much I had changed   See the first post  my introduction   It was really comforting to see a familiar face and spend time with another person of the same culture Talking with Holly s roommate  meeting some of her other classmates  and adventuring with her study abroad group to a Dragon Boat Festival outing was so much fun  I think being able to express openly how I felt being away from home for almost ten months  and feeling completely at ease without having to think about cultural differences was freeing  That s the moment I decided I wanted to start this blog  and then wrote and published my introduction And thinking back to that light bulb moment  I have absolutely no regrets  I am so glad I decided to write about this journey and all the hardships I encountered  Emotions in general are hard to express  and as a more logical person  it is even more challenging  but being able to channel my feelings into words has been a cathartic and productive experience The other part of my final weeks in China were also amazing  but I did feel like I had to have all my  lasts  and wrap up my semester  Finals were actually not as hard as midterms  and in between volunteering for the Nanjing Tech Expo Week  re visiting all my favorite restaurants  and brainstorming where to visit after exams  I was so physically tired  I probably walked 20 000 steps a day for the last few weeks  Also  I think I had  my last bubble tea  5 times for different flavors  so the calories burned evened out Another highlight of this last period of time in China was a visit from Holly and her roommate  plus the two other classmates I met in Hangzhou  The four of them took a train to Nanjing  and with me as their tour guide  we hit all my favorite tourist spots  The five of us visited the Sun Yat Sen Mausoleum  JiMing Temple  the Nanjing City Wall  Xuanwu Lake  the famous Intercontinental building  and walked the streets around Suiyuan  my Nanjing Normal University Campus  Although I was completely wiped halfway through this one day expedition  it felt so cool to be a tour guide  It was like I was a local after living in Nanjing for ten months  and there were so many fun facts and memories I could share at each site  Having everyone down for such a big adventure and trusting me to guide them on the metro stops between each location was heartwarming  I had decided I wanted to end the evening before the Americans headed back with a group dinner with my Nanjing foreigner friends from school  My favorite restaurant  a 汤包  soup dumpling  place was spacious enough for nine  so we all sat down to some delicious steamed delicacies  It was cool to see my worlds collide  as I knew how each person s personality  and how the conversations from both my friend groups would unravel  it was also weird to hear that my school friends were telling Holly about how much I changed Lastly  my last week after exams in Nanjing is worth mentioning  I had decided back at the beginning of the school year there were certain landmarks I wanted to visit  so Iana and I agreed to keep each other accountable to the list  The very last day of exams  Iana  our German friend Josi  and I visited 夫子庙  Confucious Temple   a region where little knicknacks are sold on old historic streets  My adventures with friends were non stop from there  I had seven straight days of non stop tourism  With so many different friends  a plethora of tears  and lots of farewell lunches  I had absolutely no time to sit around ">

      <p data-search="Looking back  April is tied with July as my happiest month abroad  SO much happened this month  and in the back of mind I knew I only had three more months left until it was time to go home  I suppose I mentally started wrapping up my year way too early  but with my friends in college finishing up and with warmer weather on the horizon  it felt like it was almost summer  But  I was still happy to be in school and learning a lot in classes As I settled into a routine of taking 2 morning classes for 三年级 汉语 reading amp  writing  and 口语  speaking   and also afternoon electives  I became better friends with my classmates  I ended up attending 3 out of the 4 electives offered  and because my classmates were required to take all of the classes  we were able to see each other every day in class  I really enjoyed the friend group of a few of my Korean and Thai classmates  along with my other two friends Matthew and WangFan  Matthew is from Malaysia US Mauritius  and WangFan is Chilean Chinese  I think they are both around 8 years older than I  I know my Chilean friend is at least 26 or 27  but I really enjoyed their fresh perspectives and more sophisticated talks  Never will I forget our morning walks to the 包子 shop  although I ate breakfast before class  it was still a good excuse to stretch my legs  and laughing at their daily  never changing orders All the people I saw in class and talked to during class break were all like older brothers just because they had so much more life experience  I liked feeling cared for  like a little sister with lots of big bros  and although we didn t talk about our personal lives  we still had some very interesting conversations  Embedded in my memory is our group regularly sitting outside 八号楼 where our classroom was located  on class breaks  where we just chatted  drinking weird bottled teas from the shop across the street  and shared strange stories  During breaks  we mostly sat precariously on a thin  wiry fence  and I remember falling off of it once Outside of class  I had planned a day trip a week or so before I adventured to WuYuan county with Jisoo  my Korean roommate  We had booked train tickets and decided to go to Wuxi for a day  Wuxi is a city near Nanjing that s also highly populated and plays a big part in China s east coast economy  it is also full of many tourist locations and cultural heritage sites  We simply bought our train tickets and the night before  planned out what we wanted to see  That s what I love about China  the convenience  ease  and the low stress of traveling  We decided on a visit to the LingShan Buddha  which was over an hour s bus ride from the train station  and a trip to Tai Lake  Neither of these visits exactly panned out how we had planned  resulting in a several mile walk by a busy highway while observing the famous lake  being squeezed in the back of a bus without room even to scratch my nose  I really had to  But I couldn t   and a bathroom pit stop at a random school  However  it was another really fun adventure and a good bonding moment with JiSoo  because she was so temperamentally different than my last roommate Another great part of April was the weather change  The winter had been so cold and suffocating  once warmer days came on the horizon  I could feel my spirit beginning to lift  I began to run outside on the track whenever I could  Those sunny days paired with birds chirping were absolutely perfect  Going to WuYuan  where the countryside was full of green grass and mud and streams  made me realize how much I missed nature  I even just sat in the overgrown grass in the middle of the track with my homework sometimes  just to feel the ants crawling on my leg or the itchiness of the grass  It reminded me of home  where I could go outside and see and touch the green grass if I wanted to at any time I definitely think April was my busiest month  because looking through my pictures  I also began biking with Iana during my free time  filmed a video interview project with my classmates  and celebrated a few friends  birthdays  Plus  I still had weekly taekwondo  yoga  and language exchanges  Another trip with Mackenzie to some islands off of Shanghai also occurred in April  where we got to spend 12 hours on a local fisherman s boat  Although we were only out of town for a few days  it was still so refreshing and full of adventure  Reading my journal describing this travel experience  I wrote  How was I awake at 5 30 hiking up a giant hill to get to an abandoned village  then laughing  sprinting  frantically hailing cars down through a tunnel to catch a boat  in Shanghai walking around the Bund  and now back laying in my bed  and it s only 10 pm    Good memories  Good month ">
        Looking back, April is tied with July as my happiest month abroad. SO much happened this month, and in the back of mind I knew I only had three more months left until it was time to go home. I suppose I mentally started wrapping up my year way too early, but with my friends in college finishing up and with warmer weather on the horizon, it felt like it was almost summer. But, I was still happy to be in school and learning a lot in classes.

      <p data-search="After taking a four month pause from my blog to concentrate on my first semester of college  I ve realized I need to finish recounting this journey  So much in China occurred that has shaped my life back in the US  I can t even begin to explain the amount of influence this gap year has had on my mindset  on my interactions with other people  and the mentality that I can now take with me in my everyday activities  Reflecting on my school life at UNC  I ve come to understand that I need to wrap this blog up for me  for closure Reading back over my March journal entries and revisiting the hoards of pictures taken has made me realize how much my second semester in China changed me  I think that this month was the start of a type of carefree freedom  an ability to drop all responsibilities and travel  to go explore  to go meet new people  I wanted to learn more about myself and see more new things March seems like light years away  something that happened in the past and shaped me  and feels so far off in the distance it s almost intangible  So much occurred  from the start of a new semester to fresh social dynamics  it s important to explain The beginning of the month was refreshing  Not only did I get a new roommate and had so much fun helping her around the city  from Walmart shopping adventures  free samples  anyone    and showing her my favorite food spots  I also got to meet up with old friends  It was so fun to go back to school and actually have friends to text and meet up with  I reconnected with people over gifts and laughter and good food to share our holiday break s stories  it was busy  but absolutely so full of happiness Something weird about March was the new social dynamic  because after the Italians from first semester left  there was a group of about 20 people from our old friend group staying  We all knew each other fairly well  but I think everyone began feeling like they needed their own space  This Westerner group was coined  The Survivors   and our group chat became a place for random jokes and laughs  but actual tight knit group dinners really died out As our first semester friend group became looser  I began exploring new friendships  I felt socially stretched  where I had my good friends Iana and Josi  and a few others I could comfortably talk to  but I also had my new Korean roommate  JiSoo  Having a Korean friend made a whole new realm of Asian friends open up at school  As the new semester began  I started going with Jisoo and her two friends to lunch  Although there were some Japanese and Korean students taking classes the first semester at NNU  I never really had the opportunity to interact with them  The new semester s lunch allowed me to meet so many new people and use my Chinese more An important point about my old friends was that they really encouraged me to spend time with Jisoo  I was sad that I wouldn t be able to see them as often  but I really did want to meet new people outside The Survivors group  I was thankful that my old friends wanted me to grow out of my comfort zone just as much as I did  and accepted me for who I was  I introduced my roommate to all my old friends at a birthday party  but the dynamic felt too foreign and uncomfortable for both of us  It was ok though  and I was more than glad to go with my new roommate to lunch and meet new people  Balancing school  old friends  and new friends was a real challenge  but I really loved my new adventures Another great part of the new semester was moving up to 三年级二班  My class was half full of Thai students  all from the same Thai university  and the other half of the class was just individual high level students that were from various countries  I really enjoyed the harder content of my new classes and the fresh faces  Also  I began speaking to people in class only in Chinese  and I really enjoyed that I had a new group of people to converse with Other than the new social dynamics  I d say that if I could highlight three great things of the new semester they would be 1  Beginning visiting a fancy yoga studio with a free membership card my friend Matteo gave me2  Joining taekwondo practice in Xianlin  the other NNU campus  more actively3  Taking lots of food picturesI guess I ve always liked taking photos of things  because I remember religiously holding a mini Canon camera beginning in third grade on summer trips around China  In March  I really started taking LOADS of food pictures  I mean my camera roll was filled with pretty foods  strange foods  people with food  and any other situation food could possibly be in  My friends from home even started commenting when I sent them entire albums of not my adventures around Nanjing  but my food Lastly  one of the most memorable events of the month was a last minute backpacking trip to Wuyuan County  in Jiangxi Province  My American friend Mackenzie invited me for a weekend adventure backpacking around the county to see some of the famous seasonal 油菜花  canola flowers   Although it was only a four day adventure  so much occurred  we hit up five different villages  had an adventure with our 缘分车  and missed our train on the way there  what a way to start out the weekend   If you want to hear about our stories of re booking tickets  finding last minute places to stay the night of  and trying various 年糕  sticky rice patties   ask me about it  Way too much happened in the span of this adventure to recount in this blog  Let me say  this adventure was surely a great way to wrap up the month ">
        After taking a four month pause from my blog to concentrate on my first semester of college, I’ve realized I need to finish recounting this journey. So much in China occurred that has shaped my life back in the US. I can’t even begin to explain the amount of influence this gap year has had on my mindset, on my interactions with other people, and the mentality that I can now take with me in my everyday activities. Reflecting on my school life at UNC, I’ve come to understand that I need to wrap this blog up for me, for closure.

      <p data-search="A Dedication to My Cat  Tootsie RollChange is real  and change is happening  Every single minute of the day  something on this planet changes  Whether it s an event that resonates with us for every moment of our lives following it  or a minuscule change in another person s life across the globe  it occurs  And it s real Something I admit I have yet to embrace is change  My transition from a small  private middle school to high school was hard  and the transition from a North Carolina public high school  with 2 400 students in it  to my gap year in Nanjing was not easy either  So as move in day at my in state  American university approaches  I feel hesitant to express my feelings February  my half way mark of being abroad in China  really embodied these thoughts  change was in the winds  and I wasn t sure how to feel about it  My month began with another trip to Guilin  Guangxi Province  I had been twice already that year  for both a holiday break in October  and in January with some friends  but I wanted to spend Chinese New Year  also known as the Spring Festival  with some family there  So  again  I hopped on a plane and traveled back to my birthplace During the eight or nine days of Spring Festival that I was there  I had the opportunity to meet lots of Guangxi Province locals that stopped in to pay a visit to my foster parents  I was staying with my foster parents and their daughter  so as tradition is pretty strictly still followed  almost all of their extended family members that lived fairly near came to 拜访  visit and pay their respects   In summary  we ate so much delicious food  I had lots of people tell me their last memories of me as a baby  and then I fell really sick While my foster sister  her husband and I were in his old hometown in southern  rural  Guangxi Province  I started throwing up  I didn t know why I was so sick  the only reason I could think of was that eating this delicacy that was a fried mix of sandworms with cashews made me sick  I think I also had a pretty high fever because I felt really light headed and could hardly walk  The photo below is of the house where we stayed Upon return to Nanjing  I still didn t really recover  I was staying at my mom s house  about an hour from my campus  so I had all my meals provided for and didn t have to worry about laundry  shout out to Mom  thanks    However  I slept a lot and still continued having a lot of stomach problems  I did do a couple of things around the house  though  Below is a photo of me making 汤圆  tāng yuán   a sticky rice dessert eaten for the Lantern Festival  which lands on the 15th day of the Spring festival  it marks the end of the holiday During this month of my holiday break  I also celebrated my 18th birthday  It was strange being away from my dad  my cats  my dog  and my friends  but I had my mom  so that was great  Here s a picture of me and my cake Something that I experienced that was especially hard were changes back home in North Carolina  My beloved cat  Tootsie Roll  passed away at the old age of 13  My dad had gone to pet her and apparently she was cold  I felt such sadness and knew I had lost my life long best friend when the news was broken to me  because through every stage of my life  my cat had been there for me  Well  cats can only be there so much for a human  but Tootsie was always lounging around looking for a pet  so if I ever needed an instant pillow  she was an easy first option  Tootsie also was always my warm blanket at night  my fluffy buddy  and my least favorite morning alarm  Being away from home for so long  already experiencing my family cat Tuffy s death  and then changes in my dad s life  my kitty cat s death really was a wake up call that change is inevitable  It s always happening  it affects us all  and there s nothing we can do to stop it So my month ended with lots of changes  Not actually a lot happened in Nanjing  because I wasn t in school  but I found out three things  I caught a bacterial intestinal infection  I began feeling very old after becoming  legal   and things at home in the US were changing ">

      <p data-search="January was a really  really good month and every one of my days  for the most part  were different Beginning with my week one  I began wrapping up my holiday feelings  No more festivities past our New Year s Eve party  no more group dinners  and no more free time with friends  Well  I did go to a big dinner the night before a final exam  but that was an exception  we went to get the famous Beijing roast duck  The first week  I had to begin studying for my four classes of Chinese  Two classes were main  core  class  Chinese reading writing and a listening speaking class  the other two were for essay writing and composition and business Chinese I really felt confused studying for exams during the second week  not because I did not understand the content  but because I wasn t quite sure what I was studying for  My grades did not transfer back to college in the US  and I never had planned to study anything Chinese related in college  My motivation definitely lacked during this week  but I crammed all the content in and finished with all A s for the semester The third and fourth week of January were some of the best weeks I experienced in China  My friends and I had planned a big trip to Guilin  Guangxi for sightseeing around the city and visiting the nearby rice terraces after exams finished  Guilin happens to be my hometown and birthplace  so although I did hesitate at first about joining  but once I made my decision to tag along  I was exuberated  We took an 8 hour train ride down to Guilin  stayed in an amazing hostel  explored the city  with me as everyone s guide  of course   and tried some yummy foods As wonderful as the week was  traveling with seven other people can be very exhausting  Some of my best friends  the Italians  were not returning the following semester  so I said my tearful goodbyes and wished them good luck  then flew back to Nanjing  I only had a couple days back in Nanjing before my family and I vacationed in Thailand for a week  so I settled in at my mom s and focused on packing Switching from traveling with seven other young people  down to do anything and visit everything  to traveling with a four year old  my sister  was quite a transition  My mom  stepdad  sister and I spent a whole week in Bangkok  and our time there was very slow and relaxing  All the Thai food we tried  from nice and air conditioned restaurants to aromatic street food  blew my mind  Also  the famous landmarks were amazing to sightsee and easy to get to  all with a venture on the SkyTrain and boat ride down the Chao Phraya River  Pictured below are some of my favorite sights  foods  and things we did I wrapped up my contrasting month with a big change  I cut off 8 inches of my hair  Before leaving the US  I planned that I would cut off as much hair as possible to donate to non profit hair donation center  However  my hair grew really long over the first semester  almost hitting my elbow  and I could not stand it any longer  I got a salon recommendation from my Chinese friend  booked an appointment online  and headed over for the big chop with my friend Emily  The hairdresser almost cut off the eight inches without the hair being tied in the ponytail  which would ve been tragic  but Emily caught his mistake  and I walked out of the salon with eight less inches of hair on my head  The haircut symbolized a new start  a fresh look  and a willingness to make the rest of my year as good as the last few weeks ">
        January was a really, really good month and every one of my days, for the most part, were different.

      <p data-search="As I return to the inside my grandparent s lake house in Michigan from a nice summer boat ride  I began to think  how can so much beauty be in such familiar things  Actually  my first thought was the common saying   beauty is in the simple things   However  if I think back to December  I know that beauty is not always in the SIMPLE things  because simple things can be foreign  too Thinking about my first three months  December was comparably a much better month  Although during the beginning of the month I struggled with the decision of whether or not to go with my friend group to Xi An on a vacation  I was able to set a regular routine and became very happy with the people I had formed relationships with One of the main events of December for me was running a 3k during the weekend that my friends went out of town  My Russian friend  Iana  and I headed over to Xianlin for a provincial wide  marathon   There were several distances and courses spread out around the university campus  but we didn t have a running team  so unfortunately we were not able to run a marathon or even a half marathon  So we bundled up in below freezing weather  drank lots of hot water  and ran our 3k  The organization skills of the event were not that great  but this event set the precedent for heading to the gym more and putting exercise back into my daily routine So after classes and between group dinners  I began heading to the gym with my American friend Mackenzie  Oftentimes  the outside temperature would be in the 30 s  and more times than not the pollution levels were hazardous  Running outside was simply not even an option  and biking  outside  to Nanjing University  another university located near us to access their gym was not a very good choice  either  Because I ran track and cross country off and on throughout high school  I really missed exercising  And although I did have to walk everywhere in China  I sometimes really craved a good workout  Therefore  the gym  although not connected to our university  was the best option  I always felt better after a treadmill session Also during December  I began spending a lot more time with my language exchange group  The Russian friend mentioned above  Iana  had organized this group back in September  and we met weekly to have dinner  do fun activities around Nanjing  and communicate in both English and Chinese  The group included two Chinese girls that were English majors  Iana  my friend Alex from the same area of North Carolina as I  and myself  The five us began rehearsing for a New Year s rehearsal and spent three to four times a week practicing  Although it was quite time consuming  I was really happy with the opportunity to get to see my new friends more often  Photographed below are both the performance itself and one of the dinners we had together One of the highlights of this month was Christmas  Although not all of us were Christian  we were all foreigners away from home  mostly from countries that celebrate Christmas  It was quite strange to be in a place where there were not stores full of commercial products  jolly songs floating around  and a tree to put presents underneath  Before I left  of course I knew that America as a whole is a very Christian country  but I could only keep that in mind  not knowing that it would feel empty without a general Christmas mood in the air Therefore  we all took matters into our hands  My American neighbor  Will organized a Secret Santa exchange for gifts  I set up a SignUpGenius for a Christmas Eve dinner  and the two of us worked together with my roommate Giulia to categorize foods for people to bring  After much planning  we did successfully pull it off  At the party  there were so many different ethnic foods  it included things from German potato salad and Polish pierogi to Thai salad and Chinese fried rice  and of course  I brought my homemade peanut butter jelly sandwiches Overall  December was a very busy month  I was hardly ever in my room  and between classes  eating lunch with my friends  rehearsals  language exchange meetings  and the gym  I began attending a taekwondo club in Xianlin with Iana  Although I never completely gave up on making Chinese friends through clubs  I did realize my expectations would not be lived up to  But I was content  looking forward to exams in mid January  and becoming even better friends with people I had known in previous months ">
        As I return to the inside my grandparent’s lake house in Michigan from a nice summer boat ride, I began to think, how can so much beauty be in such familiar things? Actually, my first thought was the common saying, “beauty is in the simple things”. However, if I think back to December, I know that beauty is not always in the SIMPLE things, because simple things can be foreign, too…

      <p data-search="November in the United States is a special month  it is a month of being thankful  rejoicing with family  and being glad you survived almost another year  For me  however  November was one of the hardest months being abroad  Perhaps it was the hazardous pollution that reached into the 200 s  where anything above 100 is technically unsafe   or maybe it was still a matter of an adaptation period  After all  it is only Americans that celebrate Thanksgiving  so being around non Americans celebrating different holidays abroad was quite weird at first Nevertheless  I experienced my first bout of homesickness in November  As midterms were to be held in the beginning of November  I began studying pretty hard  I wanted to make sure my grades were good because although they didn t transfer to my university in the US for the following year  they were the purpose of my study period in China and the pure validity for many people that my time abroad was worthy  Maybe others did not know that this year would be about finding my identity  my beliefs  and my comforts  but these grades sure were important Also  it didn t help that I got sick during midterm week  Surely  it was not anything more than a minor cold  but it sent me into a mentality of missing EVERYTHING  I missed my cats  my dad  my friends from high school  driving a car  all the cheesy comfort foods  and almost anything that comes to mind with the American lifestyle  I just wanted my old lifestyle back  with another clear sense of purpose I felt in high school  which was to maintain good grades to get into a prestigious university  My year abroad did not actually have a main goal other than improving my Chinese  and I struggled with those goals all of the first semester So while I missed home and began actually reaching out to friends and family from home  my friends at Nanjing Normal became even closer  I formed a friend group with my roommate Giulia  the previously mentioned half German  half Chinese girl named Emily  and another German girl Josi  We all ate dinner every night together  and although it was a good time  we did eat a lot later than I was used to  It took some adjustment to have to comply with other people s wants and needs  and although it may have resulted in some unhealthy choices  I did need that situation of being made uncomfortable and the change from the expectation of usual instant gratification to make myself more able to accept change Of course during the duration of this month  other than academics and a social life  I did keep busy with activities  I attended a fun track meet in Xianlin  went to Yangzhou  another city in JiangSu Province located near Nanjing  with a big group of friends  and visited touristy sites throughout the city  In the photo collage below are pictures of all the mentioned events I participated in  I also bought my heavy winter jacket in preparation for the freezing  polluted Nanjing and brought my roommate to my mom s about an hour from Nanjing Normal University for a Thanksgiving dinner Overall  November was a weird month  I became content with the good friends I had made  completely immersed in the foreigner culture at school  and happy with my regular schedule  except dinner was too late   I did also enjoy my adventures around in Nanjing and first experience on a Chinese train in five years when we headed to Yangzhou  Yet  I still was searching for my ultimate purpose abroad and the true calling ">
        November in the United States is a special month; it is a month of being thankful, rejoicing with family, and being glad you survived almost another year. For me, however, November was one of the hardest months being abroad. Perhaps it was the hazardous pollution that reached into the 200’s (where anything above 100 is technically unsafe), or maybe it was still a matter of an adaptation period. After all, it is only Americans that celebrate Thanksgiving, so being around non-Americans celebrating different holidays abroad was quite weird at first.

      <p data-search="Looking back to October  I d have to say my second month abroad included a whole lot of mixed feelings  Unfortunately  when we go abroad  we not only pack up our suitcases  memories  and belongings  but we also bring our expectations with us My first month in China was really  really good  It was about settling  beginning new friendships  and leaving old grievances behind  However  when I hit the second month  especially after our one week break during the state holiday week of October called  The Golden Week   I came to realize I was unhappy in some aspects  But I ll get to that only after I describe my holiday If you all  as readers  had one week with no classes  no obligations  and no idea what in the world to do to kill time  and were living abroad   what would be the best option  Traveling  of course  Due to the fact that I have connections in Guilin  China  I headed out of Nanjing as soon as classes ended for the one week holiday  I hadn t been back in five years since I had visited every summer when I was little with my mom  So all I brought with me were memories  plans of eating 桂林米粉  THE famous Guilin rice noodles   and an idea of what my visit was going to be like During my trip  I had the opportunity to visit family  take a trip to the countryside  and do lots of local things  such as eating  shopping  and cooking  Nothing actually significant happened  but I did have one big epiphany  the way I grew up in the US was a whole lot different than the people I met in Guilin did  Perhaps when I was little I didn t have a good gauge on social situations  customs  or what local norms were  But now  I do  and I felt a taste of the privilege of the way I was raised  People shared their stories with me  from working on railways to support their families to discussing governmental pay  my foster mom even shared that she had to help raise her own siblings in the 苦  bitterness and bearing of hardships  of the Cultural Revolution Therefore  going back to Nanjing  I had a lot going on in my mind  I had the opportunity to see the real China for the first time as an adult  and had sensed the deepness of the Chinese spirit to persevere  Before I departed on the Golden Week break  I had made plans to join clubs in Nanjing Normal University s other campus  Xianlin  where all the bachelor students are located  My own campus  located in the heart of downtown  is only for master s students  our campus is literally dead  with no fun campus events to be found  ever  So I returned to the student life in Nanjing and my previous plans on forming good  deep relationships with some Chinese people and learning more about the culture where I was born So I began commuting to a few school clubs in Xianlin I had committed to because they seemed interesting and exciting  One in particular was an English club  I thought that if I could find some open minded Chinese people that wanted to learn about my background  my past  and my American culture  we could be friends  I was wrong  My plans on joining that club backfired  I was ignored  excluded from conversation topics  and considered an outsider  Maybe it s the way I look  because I am Chinese American  that Chinese students didn t find anything special to talk about with me  Or maybe it s the way I was quiet  not wanting to butt into conversation topics I had no knowledge about  But that experience in Xianlin was not a pleasant one  My expectations for my year abroad versus the reality of the situation in front of me began catching up to me In the meantime  as Chinese classes really started rolling and oral presentations began being assigned  friend groups among foreigners started  In our small campus where I could walk from the back gate  where the canteen was  to the study room in my dorm building  there would hardly ever be a time where I wouldn t stop for a conversation with someone I met along the way  Well  I was hardly ever by myself  since I ate lunch and dinner with the Italians  but it was an environment where most Westerners began to really know each other  A group of about thirty of us began having late night chats at a small drink store across our front gate deemed  老板 s   laoban s   and following that we had many a midnight adventure out on the town Throughout these social happenings  I began making some really good friends  I met a German girl that was half Chinese and half German raised in Germany  another American who lived in Maryland yet graduated from a university right near my house  and a lot of half half mixed Europeans that had grown up with two cultures and languages  Now  all of these relationships were built off of conversations that happened in English  Back to the previously mentioned expectations versus reality  I had expected all relationships to be formed in Chinese  I was in China to improve my Chinese  after all  Yet  almost every friendship I formed was in my mother tongue  Even when my roommate and I had some pretty deep discussions  we were using English So my second month abroad wasn t ideal  I dealt a lot with being separated  racially  culturally  and spiritually  I was a Chinese American  born in China yet raised in the US  I couldn t completely relate to any university aged Chinese people I met  and they for sure didn t express that they wanted to get to know me  On another level  I couldn t completely relate to the Italians or any of the Europeans I began friendships with  because English was not their mother tongue and they could at least improve their language skills using English to communicate with other foreigners  And lastly  I felt torn apart by my goals  My mind  my spirit  told me I had come to China with a purpose  to learn Chinese  to make Chinese friends  and to learn more about myself  And that last point would be stretched out throughout the year abroad ">
        Looking back to October, I’d have to say my second month abroad included a whole lot of mixed feelings. Unfortunately, when we go abroad, we not only pack up our suitcases, memories, and belongings, but we also bring our expectations with us.

      <p data-search="Since I ve returned home  life s kept me moving  I came back to an untouched bedroom  an ever busy and hectic schedule with my dad  a similar lifestyle at my mom s  and the same high school friends doing the same exact things around town  However  over the last few days  I ve felt like I need to recapture my experience abroad  to reflect  to think  and to improve from my experiences  So my first real blog post here is about my Month 1  September The first month really felt like a blur  There was  of course  an adjustment period  to the strange foreigners living abroad culture  my new Italian roommate  and living by myself for the first time ever  I needed to learn how to walk around my new campus at Nanjing Normal University without getting lost  where to get food  and how to  cope with only having myself as a reliable source of help  It was hard to eat dinner alone  to look on social media  and feel lonely while my friends from home had already settled into their college lifestyles Yet  I grew by myself  I realized a lot about home  both good and bad  I came to understand that high school was a bubble  nobody in the big picture cares about what you wear  where you live  or how many connections to school programs you have past those four years  Honestly  I ve only kept a few strong relationships this past year from all people I spent four years with  mostly  I have memories  In the meantime  I began meeting other foreigners around campus and during touristy outings arranged in our group chat  Some were also on the same scholarship as I  others were friends with my roommate  An important person in my first month was another student on a gap year from a similar region as I in North Carolina  the Triangle   we were able to connect because of similar backgrounds and the same feeling of being lost  I also began forming a special relationship with my roommate that would be unparalleled with anyone else throughout the rest of the year As I made it through registration  venturing to the canteen without walking the opposite direction  and prepping for the placement exam in the school library  classes soon started  I began taking full immersion Chinese classes from 8 to 11 50 in the morning  with mostly Italians in my class that had come with my roommate from the same university in Italy  My classes felt strange  not because they were taught in a different language  but because there was hardly any REAL homework and the amount of effort I had to put in was significantly less than high school I soon got in a schedule  though  and I felt content  I knew the people in my class  I began friendships with other scholarship students  and my roommate and I ventured around the giant city taking the subway to shop  dine  or visit Nanjing landmarks  Life was good  life was settling ">
        Since I’ve returned home, life’s kept me moving. I came back to an untouched bedroom, an ever-busy and hectic schedule with my dad, a similar lifestyle at my mom’s, and the same high school friends doing the same exact things around town. However, over the last few days, I’ve felt like I need to recapture my experience abroad: to reflect, to think, and to improve from my experiences. So my first real blog post here is about my Month 1: September.
