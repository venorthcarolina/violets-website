<p>Hi everyone, and welcome to my personal blog. I have been passionate about blogging since I was 9, when I created my own Weebly domain for my cat club. I’ve come a long way since then, but my passion for writing still remains. Below I show some of my past blog posts, with topics ranging from my journey to graduate school to my experience taking a gap year in Nanjing, China. I hope to keep up with my blog as I continue to transition into my next phase of life.</p>

At the Institute, we all get assigned to practicum sponsors and teams of five for our yearlong project. Even though it was over 10 months ago, I still distinctly remember the nervous pit in my stomach when it was “reveal” day. With a class of 95 students and a split between Blue and Orange cohorts, I knew that I could end up with any four other classmates on my team. I also had no idea which government or corporate sponsor I’d be assigned to.

      <p data-search="During my first week in the program  the question I received the most was   What made you want to come to the Institute   Although my answer is complex  most often  I would respond that I studied biostatistics at UNC for my undergraduate studies   as if this was an explanation for pursuing graduate school  In this post  I reflect on my monumental experiences in undergrad by exploring my gradual realization of why I needed a master s degree and discussing why I chose data analytics Reflection On Internship ExperiencesLooking back at my three and a half years at UNC Chapel Hill  one of my proudest moments was when I received my dream summer internship at CVS Health  My main goal in professional extracurricular experiences was to gain real world experience and get quality feedback on my work I saw CVS Health as an opportunity to get hands on experience on projects under direct supervision while working on a team to achieve larger corporate goals  The internship provided me with just those dreams   I worked on a health equity roadmap intervention for dialysis patients in Austin  Texas  collaborated with communication team members to update the internal Sharepoint site  and even shadowed a master s data science student working on a similar project about social determinants of health  The jobs right out of undergrad fit for my skill set seemed to be focused on statistical programming rather than having a larger variety of tasks and independence in projects  while graduate school would provide education on a specialist topic and help me gain in depth knowledge  I found a year long remote research position at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  NIEHS  and decided that this experience would cement my decision for the future   if I enjoyed research  I d pursue a PhD  otherwise  I decided I would do a master s My summer  fall  and spring at NIEHS was a huge learning curve  but it provided time where I could experiment in R Studio  better understand bioinformatics  and explore a federal research environment  My program guided eleven undergraduates in professional workshops and through poster presentations to a broader NIEHS audience  I found value in the networking opportunities and the collaborative teamwork elements of the program  I also realized I enjoyed the coding and problem solving more than the aspects of genomic data and methodology Reflection On Graduate SchoolI recognized the necessity of obtaining a master s degree  yet the recurring question that plagued me was   Which specific field should I pursue   Some criteria that cycled through my mind included being relatively affordable  with a strong preference for in state in North Carolina  having less than a two year commitment  and providing a strong record for employment following graduation  I debated between a degree in public health  business  or statistics  specifically  UNC has a great two year biostatistics master of science  and Boston University has a one year applied biostatistics program with good ties to the life sciences Reflection On the InstituteThe gradual realization of why I needed graduate school began to outweigh all of my criteria for staying in the public health realm of my undergraduate major  and I began to learn about the Institute for Advanced Analytics and NCSU  The 10 month program fulfilled all of my criteria for graduate school  and an added benefit was the close proximity to my family  I began leaning towards the idea of a non public health data science program and committed to my decision  Since I ve been in the program  I haven t looked back  not even once  The  why data analytics   question quickly became answered as coursework in foundational statistics  Python and R programming  and summer practicum ramped up  I found myself immersed in how to communicate data science to a non technical audience and set personal goals for applying data analytics  The application aspect of the program has been crucial to my development as a data scientist In the last three months  I ve already assembled a complete pie of knowledge and skills  Each slice on my plate represents a different aspect of our cohort s learning journey  including statistics  programming  ethical considerations for data professionals  cross cultural communication  computer security  networking in a professional context  and the art of setting tangible goals  We continue to fill our plates  one day at a time ">
        During my first week in the program, the question I received the most was: “What made you want to come to the Institute?” Although my answer is complex, most often, I would respond that I studied biostatistics at UNC for my undergraduate studies – as if this was an explanation for pursuing graduate school. In this post, I reflect on my monumental experiences in undergrad by exploring my gradual realization of why I needed a master’s degree and discussing why I chose data analytics.

      <p data-search="As I return to the inside my grandparent s lake house in Michigan from a nice summer boat ride  I began to think  how can so much beauty be in such familiar things  Actually  my first thought was the common saying   beauty is in the simple things   However  if I think back to December  I know that beauty is not always in the SIMPLE things  because simple things can be foreign  too Thinking about my first three months  December was comparably a much better month  Although during the beginning of the month I struggled with the decision of whether or not to go with my friend group to Xi An on a vacation  I was able to set a regular routine and became very happy with the people I had formed relationships with One of the main events of December for me was running a 3k during the weekend that my friends went out of town  My Russian friend  Iana  and I headed over to Xianlin for a provincial wide  marathon   There were several distances and courses spread out around the university campus  but we didn t have a running team  so unfortunately we were not able to run a marathon or even a half marathon  So we bundled up in below freezing weather  drank lots of hot water  and ran our 3k  The organization skills of the event were not that great  but this event set the precedent for heading to the gym more and putting exercise back into my daily routine So after classes and between group dinners  I began heading to the gym with my American friend Mackenzie  Oftentimes  the outside temperature would be in the 30 s  and more times than not the pollution levels were hazardous  Running outside was simply not even an option  and biking  outside  to Nanjing University  another university located near us to access their gym was not a very good choice  either  Because I ran track and cross country off and on throughout high school  I really missed exercising  And although I did have to walk everywhere in China  I sometimes really craved a good workout  Therefore  the gym  although not connected to our university  was the best option  I always felt better after a treadmill session Also during December  I began spending a lot more time with my language exchange group  The Russian friend mentioned above  Iana  had organized this group back in September  and we met weekly to have dinner  do fun activities around Nanjing  and communicate in both English and Chinese  The group included two Chinese girls that were English majors  Iana  my friend Alex from the same area of North Carolina as I  and myself  The five us began rehearsing for a New Year s rehearsal and spent three to four times a week practicing  Although it was quite time consuming  I was really happy with the opportunity to get to see my new friends more often  Photographed below are both the performance itself and one of the dinners we had together One of the highlights of this month was Christmas  Although not all of us were Christian  we were all foreigners away from home  mostly from countries that celebrate Christmas  It was quite strange to be in a place where there were not stores full of commercial products  jolly songs floating around  and a tree to put presents underneath  Before I left  of course I knew that America as a whole is a very Christian country  but I could only keep that in mind  not knowing that it would feel empty without a general Christmas mood in the air Therefore  we all took matters into our hands  My American neighbor  Will organized a Secret Santa exchange for gifts  I set up a SignUpGenius for a Christmas Eve dinner  and the two of us worked together with my roommate Giulia to categorize foods for people to bring  After much planning  we did successfully pull it off  At the party  there were so many different ethnic foods  it included things from German potato salad and Polish pierogi to Thai salad and Chinese fried rice  and of course  I brought my homemade peanut butter jelly sandwiches Overall  December was a very busy month  I was hardly ever in my room  and between classes  eating lunch with my friends  rehearsals  language exchange meetings  and the gym  I began attending a taekwondo club in Xianlin with Iana  Although I never completely gave up on making Chinese friends through clubs  I did realize my expectations would not be lived up to  But I was content  looking forward to exams in mid January  and becoming even better friends with people I had known in previous months ">
        As I return to the inside my grandparent’s lake house in Michigan from a nice summer boat ride, I began to think, how can so much beauty be in such familiar things? Actually, my first thought was the common saying, “beauty is in the simple things”. However, if I think back to December, I know that beauty is not always in the SIMPLE things, because simple things can be foreign, too…

      <p data-search="November in the United States is a special month  it is a month of being thankful  rejoicing with family  and being glad you survived almost another year  For me  however  November was one of the hardest months being abroad  Perhaps it was the hazardous pollution that reached into the 200 s  where anything above 100 is technically unsafe   or maybe it was still a matter of an adaptation period  After all  it is only Americans that celebrate Thanksgiving  so being around non Americans celebrating different holidays abroad was quite weird at first Nevertheless  I experienced my first bout of homesickness in November  As midterms were to be held in the beginning of November  I began studying pretty hard  I wanted to make sure my grades were good because although they didn t transfer to my university in the US for the following year  they were the purpose of my study period in China and the pure validity for many people that my time abroad was worthy  Maybe others did not know that this year would be about finding my identity  my beliefs  and my comforts  but these grades sure were important Also  it didn t help that I got sick during midterm week  Surely  it was not anything more than a minor cold  but it sent me into a mentality of missing EVERYTHING  I missed my cats  my dad  my friends from high school  driving a car  all the cheesy comfort foods  and almost anything that comes to mind with the American lifestyle  I just wanted my old lifestyle back  with another clear sense of purpose I felt in high school  which was to maintain good grades to get into a prestigious university  My year abroad did not actually have a main goal other than improving my Chinese  and I struggled with those goals all of the first semester So while I missed home and began actually reaching out to friends and family from home  my friends at Nanjing Normal became even closer  I formed a friend group with my roommate Giulia  the previously mentioned half German  half Chinese girl named Emily  and another German girl Josi  We all ate dinner every night together  and although it was a good time  we did eat a lot later than I was used to  It took some adjustment to have to comply with other people s wants and needs  and although it may have resulted in some unhealthy choices  I did need that situation of being made uncomfortable and the change from the expectation of usual instant gratification to make myself more able to accept change Of course during the duration of this month  other than academics and a social life  I did keep busy with activities  I attended a fun track meet in Xianlin  went to Yangzhou  another city in JiangSu Province located near Nanjing  with a big group of friends  and visited touristy sites throughout the city  In the photo collage below are pictures of all the mentioned events I participated in  I also bought my heavy winter jacket in preparation for the freezing  polluted Nanjing and brought my roommate to my mom s about an hour from Nanjing Normal University for a Thanksgiving dinner Overall  November was a weird month  I became content with the good friends I had made  completely immersed in the foreigner culture at school  and happy with my regular schedule  except dinner was too late   I did also enjoy my adventures around in Nanjing and first experience on a Chinese train in five years when we headed to Yangzhou  Yet  I still was searching for my ultimate purpose abroad and the true calling ">
        November in the United States is a special month; it is a month of being thankful, rejoicing with family, and being glad you survived almost another year. For me, however, November was one of the hardest months being abroad. Perhaps it was the hazardous pollution that reached into the 200’s (where anything above 100 is technically unsafe), or maybe it was still a matter of an adaptation period. After all, it is only Americans that celebrate Thanksgiving, so being around non-Americans celebrating different holidays abroad was quite weird at first.

      <p data-search="Looking back to October  I d have to say my second month abroad included a whole lot of mixed feelings  Unfortunately  when we go abroad  we not only pack up our suitcases  memories  and belongings  but we also bring our expectations with us My first month in China was really  really good  It was about settling  beginning new friendships  and leaving old grievances behind  However  when I hit the second month  especially after our one week break during the state holiday week of October called  The Golden Week   I came to realize I was unhappy in some aspects  But I ll get to that only after I describe my holiday If you all  as readers  had one week with no classes  no obligations  and no idea what in the world to do to kill time  and were living abroad   what would be the best option  Traveling  of course  Due to the fact that I have connections in Guilin  China  I headed out of Nanjing as soon as classes ended for the one week holiday  I hadn t been back in five years since I had visited every summer when I was little with my mom  So all I brought with me were memories  plans of eating 桂林米粉  THE famous Guilin rice noodles   and an idea of what my visit was going to be like During my trip  I had the opportunity to visit family  take a trip to the countryside  and do lots of local things  such as eating  shopping  and cooking  Nothing actually significant happened  but I did have one big epiphany  the way I grew up in the US was a whole lot different than the people I met in Guilin did  Perhaps when I was little I didn t have a good gauge on social situations  customs  or what local norms were  But now  I do  and I felt a taste of the privilege of the way I was raised  People shared their stories with me  from working on railways to support their families to discussing governmental pay  my foster mom even shared that she had to help raise her own siblings in the 苦  bitterness and bearing of hardships  of the Cultural Revolution Therefore  going back to Nanjing  I had a lot going on in my mind  I had the opportunity to see the real China for the first time as an adult  and had sensed the deepness of the Chinese spirit to persevere  Before I departed on the Golden Week break  I had made plans to join clubs in Nanjing Normal University s other campus  Xianlin  where all the bachelor students are located  My own campus  located in the heart of downtown  is only for master s students  our campus is literally dead  with no fun campus events to be found  ever  So I returned to the student life in Nanjing and my previous plans on forming good  deep relationships with some Chinese people and learning more about the culture where I was born So I began commuting to a few school clubs in Xianlin I had committed to because they seemed interesting and exciting  One in particular was an English club  I thought that if I could find some open minded Chinese people that wanted to learn about my background  my past  and my American culture  we could be friends  I was wrong  My plans on joining that club backfired  I was ignored  excluded from conversation topics  and considered an outsider  Maybe it s the way I look  because I am Chinese American  that Chinese students didn t find anything special to talk about with me  Or maybe it s the way I was quiet  not wanting to butt into conversation topics I had no knowledge about  But that experience in Xianlin was not a pleasant one  My expectations for my year abroad versus the reality of the situation in front of me began catching up to me In the meantime  as Chinese classes really started rolling and oral presentations began being assigned  friend groups among foreigners started  In our small campus where I could walk from the back gate  where the canteen was  to the study room in my dorm building  there would hardly ever be a time where I wouldn t stop for a conversation with someone I met along the way  Well  I was hardly ever by myself  since I ate lunch and dinner with the Italians  but it was an environment where most Westerners began to really know each other  A group of about thirty of us began having late night chats at a small drink store across our front gate deemed  老板 s   laoban s   and following that we had many a midnight adventure out on the town Throughout these social happenings  I began making some really good friends  I met a German girl that was half Chinese and half German raised in Germany  another American who lived in Maryland yet graduated from a university right near my house  and a lot of half half mixed Europeans that had grown up with two cultures and languages  Now  all of these relationships were built off of conversations that happened in English  Back to the previously mentioned expectations versus reality  I had expected all relationships to be formed in Chinese  I was in China to improve my Chinese  after all  Yet  almost every friendship I formed was in my mother tongue  Even when my roommate and I had some pretty deep discussions  we were using English So my second month abroad wasn t ideal  I dealt a lot with being separated  racially  culturally  and spiritually  I was a Chinese American  born in China yet raised in the US  I couldn t completely relate to any university aged Chinese people I met  and they for sure didn t express that they wanted to get to know me  On another level  I couldn t completely relate to the Italians or any of the Europeans I began friendships with  because English was not their mother tongue and they could at least improve their language skills using English to communicate with other foreigners  And lastly  I felt torn apart by my goals  My mind  my spirit  told me I had come to China with a purpose  to learn Chinese  to make Chinese friends  and to learn more about myself  And that last point would be stretched out throughout the year abroad ">
        Looking back to October, I’d have to say my second month abroad included a whole lot of mixed feelings. Unfortunately, when we go abroad, we not only pack up our suitcases, memories, and belongings, but we also bring our expectations with us.

      <p data-search="Since I ve returned home  life s kept me moving  I came back to an untouched bedroom  an ever busy and hectic schedule with my dad  a similar lifestyle at my mom s  and the same high school friends doing the same exact things around town  However  over the last few days  I ve felt like I need to recapture my experience abroad  to reflect  to think  and to improve from my experiences  So my first real blog post here is about my Month 1  September The first month really felt like a blur  There was  of course  an adjustment period  to the strange foreigners living abroad culture  my new Italian roommate  and living by myself for the first time ever  I needed to learn how to walk around my new campus at Nanjing Normal University without getting lost  where to get food  and how to  cope with only having myself as a reliable source of help  It was hard to eat dinner alone  to look on social media  and feel lonely while my friends from home had already settled into their college lifestyles Yet  I grew by myself  I realized a lot about home  both good and bad  I came to understand that high school was a bubble  nobody in the big picture cares about what you wear  where you live  or how many connections to school programs you have past those four years  Honestly  I ve only kept a few strong relationships this past year from all people I spent four years with  mostly  I have memories  In the meantime  I began meeting other foreigners around campus and during touristy outings arranged in our group chat  Some were also on the same scholarship as I  others were friends with my roommate  An important person in my first month was another student on a gap year from a similar region as I in North Carolina  the Triangle   we were able to connect because of similar backgrounds and the same feeling of being lost  I also began forming a special relationship with my roommate that would be unparalleled with anyone else throughout the rest of the year As I made it through registration  venturing to the canteen without walking the opposite direction  and prepping for the placement exam in the school library  classes soon started  I began taking full immersion Chinese classes from 8 to 11 50 in the morning  with mostly Italians in my class that had come with my roommate from the same university in Italy  My classes felt strange  not because they were taught in a different language  but because there was hardly any REAL homework and the amount of effort I had to put in was significantly less than high school I soon got in a schedule  though  and I felt content  I knew the people in my class  I began friendships with other scholarship students  and my roommate and I ventured around the giant city taking the subway to shop  dine  or visit Nanjing landmarks  Life was good  life was settling ">
        Since I’ve returned home, life’s kept me moving. I came back to an untouched bedroom, an ever-busy and hectic schedule with my dad, a similar lifestyle at my mom’s, and the same high school friends doing the same exact things around town. However, over the last few days, I’ve felt like I need to recapture my experience abroad: to reflect, to think, and to improve from my experiences. So my first real blog post here is about my Month 1: September.
