<p>Hi everyone, and welcome to my personal blog. I have been passionate about blogging since I was 9, when I created my own Weebly domain for my cat club. I’ve come a long way since then, but my passion for writing still remains. Below I show some of my past blog posts, with topics ranging from my journey to graduate school to my experience taking a gap year in Nanjing, China. I hope to keep up with my blog as I continue to transition into my next phase of life.</p>

At the Institute, we all get assigned to practicum sponsors and teams of five for our yearlong project. Even though it was over 10 months ago, I still distinctly remember the nervous pit in my stomach when it was “reveal” day. With a class of 95 students and a split between Blue and Orange cohorts, I knew that I could end up with any four other classmates on my team. I also had no idea which government or corporate sponsor I’d be assigned to.

        During my first week in the program, the question I received the most was: “What made you want to come to the Institute?” Although my answer is complex, most often, I would respond that I studied biostatistics at UNC for my undergraduate studies – as if this was an explanation for pursuing graduate school. In this post, I reflect on my monumental experiences in undergrad by exploring my gradual realization of why I needed a master’s degree and discussing why I chose data analytics.

      <p data-search="Since I ve returned home  life s kept me moving  I came back to an untouched bedroom  an ever busy and hectic schedule with my dad  a similar lifestyle at my mom s  and the same high school friends doing the same exact things around town  However  over the last few days  I ve felt like I need to recapture my experience abroad  to reflect  to think  and to improve from my experiences  So my first real blog post here is about my Month 1  September The first month really felt like a blur  There was  of course  an adjustment period  to the strange foreigners living abroad culture  my new Italian roommate  and living by myself for the first time ever  I needed to learn how to walk around my new campus at Nanjing Normal University without getting lost  where to get food  and how to  cope with only having myself as a reliable source of help  It was hard to eat dinner alone  to look on social media  and feel lonely while my friends from home had already settled into their college lifestyles Yet  I grew by myself  I realized a lot about home  both good and bad  I came to understand that high school was a bubble  nobody in the big picture cares about what you wear  where you live  or how many connections to school programs you have past those four years  Honestly  I ve only kept a few strong relationships this past year from all people I spent four years with  mostly  I have memories  In the meantime  I began meeting other foreigners around campus and during touristy outings arranged in our group chat  Some were also on the same scholarship as I  others were friends with my roommate  An important person in my first month was another student on a gap year from a similar region as I in North Carolina  the Triangle   we were able to connect because of similar backgrounds and the same feeling of being lost  I also began forming a special relationship with my roommate that would be unparalleled with anyone else throughout the rest of the year As I made it through registration  venturing to the canteen without walking the opposite direction  and prepping for the placement exam in the school library  classes soon started  I began taking full immersion Chinese classes from 8 to 11 50 in the morning  with mostly Italians in my class that had come with my roommate from the same university in Italy  My classes felt strange  not because they were taught in a different language  but because there was hardly any REAL homework and the amount of effort I had to put in was significantly less than high school I soon got in a schedule  though  and I felt content  I knew the people in my class  I began friendships with other scholarship students  and my roommate and I ventured around the giant city taking the subway to shop  dine  or visit Nanjing landmarks  Life was good  life was settling ">
        Since I’ve returned home, life’s kept me moving. I came back to an untouched bedroom, an ever-busy and hectic schedule with my dad, a similar lifestyle at my mom’s, and the same high school friends doing the same exact things around town. However, over the last few days, I’ve felt like I need to recapture my experience abroad: to reflect, to think, and to improve from my experiences. So my first real blog post here is about my Month 1: September.

        I’m sitting on a bench. Crying. Not because my legs are full of mosquito bites, not because I have to wait for my friend to finish her project and meet me, and not because I’m sweaty from hiking.
