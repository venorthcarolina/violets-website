# {% include icon.html icon="fa fa-cloud" %} Personal Blog

Hi everyone, and welcome to my personal blog. I have been passionate about blogging since I was 9, when I created my own Weebly domain for my cat club. I've come a long way since then, but my passion for writing still remains. Below I show some of my past blog posts, with topics ranging from my journey to graduate school to my experience taking a gap year in Nanjing, China. I hope to keep up with my blog as I continue to transition into my next phase of life.
