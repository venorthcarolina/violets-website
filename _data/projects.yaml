  description: I created a study with non-biomedical IRB rights that investigates the relationship between being a Chinese woman born under the One Child Policy and satisfaction in both personal life and careers. This was as a 2021 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Recipient under the supervision of Dr. Gang Yue.  Specifically, the project included both quantitative and qualitative elements. I recruited 66 female participants and used SAS 9.4 to assess participants' satisfaction outcomes in both personal life and career aspects; I also performed descriptive and thematic analyses in ATLAS.ti following the verbal interviews.

  description: My project partner Gloria Su and I utilized Python to scrape 114 rows of data from Yelp to analyze factors contributing to boba shop ratings across Raleigh, NC and New York City, NY. Using R, I found a significance difference in mean ratings and determined 7 important variables explaining why Raleigh boba shops are rated higher than New York City. I published my data and results in a Bookdown and repository on GitHub, which can be accessed by clicking the link above.
