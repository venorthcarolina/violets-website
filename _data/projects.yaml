  description: I created a study with non-biomedical IRB rights that investigates the relationship between being a Chinese woman born under the One Child Policy and satisfaction in both personal life and careers. This was as a 2021 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Recipient under the supervision of Dr. Gang Yue.  Specifically, the project included both quantitative and qualitative elements. I recruited 66 female participants and used SAS 9.4 to assess participants' satisfaction outcomes in both personal life and career aspects; I also performed descriptive and thematic analyses in ATLAS.ti following the verbal interviews.
